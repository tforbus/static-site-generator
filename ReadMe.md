# Static Site Generator
===
I want to create a static site generator using gulp. I'll work more on this project later, 
but want to start a repo so I feel obligated to do something.

## Requirements
===
- Render HTML from MarkDown.
- Templating should allow for partials, includes, parent views, etc.
- Allow different sections of the website to have their own subpages.
- No CoffeeScript
